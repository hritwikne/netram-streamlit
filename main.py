    Given the image of a (isolated) word in a natural scene (like billboards, banners), 
    the app predicts the text in the image. This problem is formally stated as **Scene Text Recognition**.

        For an input image that is not cropped down to the word, two machine learning models are used in this application: 
        (1) detecting text in the image and cropping it, and (2) recognising the word in that cropped image.  

        So providing an uncropped image would pass it through two different models, thus multiplying the error rates.
        Therefore, for better predictions, provide a cropped word image so that only the recognition system has to be activated.
